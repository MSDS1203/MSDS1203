## Hi everyone!

My name is Marian. I'm deeply passionate about research, with a strong focus on deep learning and computer vision. I'm also enthusiastic about video game development both technically and artistically.
Whether it's building intelligent models, analyzing visual data, or crafting immersive environments, I'm always excited to learn, experiment, and contribute. 

### Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, etc.   
**Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Three.js, React  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, Unity, Blender, VS Code, Eclipse

### Research Projects
Current project: 
- **Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction**  
  Currently developing a ViT-based cancer classification pipeline using CAMELYON17 and benchmarking performance across HPC systems. *(Python)*

Past/Completed Project: 
-  **Fashion Image Classifier**  
  Conducted a comparative study of CNN models (VGG, AlexNet, LeNet) in fashion image classification using hyperparameter tuning. *(Python)*
    - Paper accepted to the 10th International Conference on Big Data Analytics, Data Mining and Computational
Intelligence.

### Recently Completed Personal Projects:
- **Simulation-Showcase**
Built an interactive, realistic 3D environment using **Three.js**, with furniture models, collision detection, texture loading, and camera control *(Three.js, HTML, CSS)*
- **Snack-Bytes**
  Created a retro game collection with original art, using Firebase for user authentication and backend support. *(Javascript, HTML, CSS, Procreate)*

Current projects: 
-  **Passion Projects/Trackers**  
  Experimenting with different art styles and such to create video games from scratch. Also keeping skills sharp with projects like trackers and such. *(C#, Python, Java, C/C++)*

- **Image Segmentation Project** *(In Progress Research)*
