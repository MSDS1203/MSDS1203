## Hi everyone!

My name is Marian. I'm deeply passionate about research, with a strong focus on deep learning and computer vision. I'm also enthusiastic about video game development both technically and artistically.
Whether it's building intelligent models, analyzing visual data, or crafting immersive environments, I'm always excited to learn, experiment, and contribute. 

### Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, etc.   
**Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Three.js, React  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, Unity, Blender, VS Code, Eclipse

### Research/Projects

Projects from the past: 
-  **Fashion Image Classifier**  
  Conducted a comparative study of CNN models (VGG, AlexNet, LeNet) in fashion image classification using hyperparameter tuning. *(Python)*
    - Paper accepted to the 10th International Conference on Big Data Analytics, Data Mining and Computational
Intelligence.

- **Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction**  
  Explored supervised learning techniques to predict cancer recurrence using attention-based MIL and patch-level CNN scoring from histopathology Whole Slide Images. *(Python)*

Recently completed passion projects:
- **Simulation-Showcase**
Built an interactive, realistic 3D environment using **Three.js**, with furniture models, collision detection, texture loading, and camera control *(Three.js, HTML, CSS)*
- **Snack-Bytes**
  Created a retro game collection with original art, using Firebase for user authentication and backend support. *(Javascript, HTML, CSS, Procreate)*

Current projects: 
-  **Passion Projects/Trackers**  
  Experimenting with different art styles and such to create video games from scratch. Also keeping skills sharp with projects like trackers and such. *(C#, Python, Java, C/C++)*

- **Image Segmentation Project** *(In Progress Research)*
